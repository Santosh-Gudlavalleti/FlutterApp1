A new Flutter application, that can be used to order various items. Taste, Quantity can be customised on a case to case basis, as per requiremts. The data regarding available items, dishes that are being cooked etc is retrieved from the server and is displayed.

## Insights of the App

The app includes various features like HTTP requests, API calls etc while having an established communication between the App and the Server. 
The Json data is decoded and the necessary items are displayed using various Packages, Widgets etc like GridView, IntroSlider, ListViews, SpeedDial etc
The app can be directly run on both Android and iOS(Thanks to Flutter :))

PS: Do not try to run the code directly, The secret-Key(Password) is not available and hence will pop up errors
